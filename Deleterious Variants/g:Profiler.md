# Performing Gene Enrichment Analysis using g:Profiler

We can use the output from SnpEff to plug into g:Profiler. g:Profiler is a public web server for characterising and manipulating gene lists. 

# g:GOST 

From the website: 

"g:GOSt performs functional profiling of gene lists using various kinds of biological evidence. The tool performs statistical enrichment analysis to find over-representation of information from Gene Ontology terms, biological pathways, regulatory DNA elements, human disease gene annotations, and protein-protein interaction networks."
"g:GOSt uses Fisher's one-tailed test, also known as cumulative hypergeometric probability, as the p-value measuring the randomness of the intersection between the query and the ontology term. The p-value represents the probability of the observed intersection plus probabilities of all larger, more extreme intersections."
